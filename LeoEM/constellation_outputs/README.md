## Constellation Spatial Data

Please run the first stage in `StarPerf_MATLAB_stage/` and generate the output on your own.

You could also directly use those public spatial data available at [StarPerf](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ncxf84a1m9uznm2/AABwrzHdKX6ZXsEb6FV6L3foa?dl=0) and skip this stage. Simply download and put the data here. E.g., `constellation_outputs/Starlink/`.
