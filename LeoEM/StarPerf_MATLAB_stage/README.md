## LEO Constellation Construction

**We adopt [StarPerf](https://github.com/SpaceNetLab/StarPerf_Simulator)'s solution for this stage**. You could go through StarPerf's README to understand the details. 

### Prerequisites

As mentioned in StarPerf, the solution relies on 

1. [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
2. [Ansys STK with evaluation license](https://www.ansys.com/products/missions/ansys-stk)

With prerequisites installed, run the MATLAB entry-point script `build_constellation.m`, and the constellation spatial data will be generated at `constellation_outputs\`.

You could also directly use those public spatial data available at [StarPerf](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ncxf84a1m9uznm2/AABwrzHdKX6ZXsEb6FV6L3foa?dl=0) and skip this stage.
